# 🌑 Reddit Void: The Daily Reveal

**Reddit Void** is a collaborative, daily "pixel-hunt" mystery game built for the Reddit Devvit Hackathon. It turns a simple black canvas into a massive social experiment where Redditors must work together to identify a hidden image.

## 🚀 The Concept
Every 24 hours, a new image is hidden behind a shroud of darkness. 
- **Limited Interaction:** Each user is granted only **5 Light Charges** per day.
- **Global Collaboration:** Users must share what they see in the **comment section** to help others identify the image without wasting their own charges.
- **Daily Refresh:** The game automatically updates based on the system date, providing a fresh challenge every morning.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML5 Canvas:** For high-performance, mobile-optimized rendering.
- **JavaScript:** Custom "Date-to-Puzzle" controller for daily automation.
- **CSS3:** Responsive UI designed for the Reddit mobile web-view.

## 🏆 Hackathon Categories
- **Best Daily Game:** Features a strong recurring mechanic and daily resets.
- **Best Mobile Game Play:** Optimized for touch interactions and seamless mobile UX.
- **Best Use of User Contributions:** The core gameplay loop relies on community discussion and shared clues in the Reddit comments.

## 📖 How to Play
1. Click anywhere in the "Void" to reveal a small circle of the hidden image.
2. Monitor your **Charges**. Once they hit zero, you must rely on others.
3. Use the **Free Hint** button if the community is stuck.
4. Type your guess in the box. If correct, the entire image is revealed!
